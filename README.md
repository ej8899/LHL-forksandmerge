# LHL-forksandmerge
playing with forks and merges for LHL experimentation


Fork it, branch it, play with it - see how it works back and forth between different users -- and create your own test repo for other users to manipulate so you can see how it works as an 'owner' of the code. this is an add on line 5, but we'll remove it from test account.

A simple text file like this is all that is needed to see how it functions. 

updated by ej8899 test account to add a line 9.
