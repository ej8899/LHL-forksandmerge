# LHL-forksandmerge
playing with forks and merges for LHL experimentation


Fork it, branch it, play with it - see how it works back and forth between different users -- and create your own test repo for other users to manipulate so you can see how it works as an 'owner' of the code. (rmeoved by test user)

A simple text file like this is all that is needed to see how it functions. 

updated by ej8899 test account to add a line 9.
